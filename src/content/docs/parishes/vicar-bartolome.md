* **About:** Established in 1614 by Augustinian missionaries, San Bartolome Parish stands as the oldest church in the Diocese of Kalookan, surviving a turbulent history of natural disasters and wartime destruction. After being burned during the 1898 Revolution, the church remained in ruins until a renovation by Fr. Lino Kawili sparked a legal dispute that briefly alienated the local faithful. The community’s spiritual revival was ultimately triggered in 1929 by the Maryknoll Sisters of New York, whose leadership of the Malabon Normal School restored the people's faith and galvanized them to rebuild the parish both physically and organizationally. Despite a history marked by loss and reconstruction, San Bartolome Parish remains a resilient legacy and a cornerstone of unity for its parishioners today.

* **About:** The Exaltation of the Holy Cross Parish in Hulong Duhat, Malabon, originated from the 1867 discovery of a miraculous cross carved from a duhat tree, which led to the construction of a beloved "Little Cathedral" under the care of the Baens family. The community’s devotion was famously tested during the Aglipayan Schism of 1902, where residents remained steadfastly loyal to the Catholic Church despite pressure from local administrators to convert. Following decades of community-led fundraising and renovations spearheaded by the Hulong Duhat Community Movement, the aging chapel was transformed into a formal parish, officially established by Cardinal Jaime Sin on September 26, 1994. Today, the parish stands as a testament to the resilience of its parishioners’ faith, continuing its mission under a succession of dedicated priests including its first pastor, Rev. Fr. Nelson Orqueta, and the current priest, Rev. Fr. Octavio Bartiana.

* **About:** Originally a bamboo chapel and Augustinian rest house established in the late 19th century, the Immaculate Conception Parish in Malabon carries a history of resilience and legal triumph. Despite the demolition of the structure by an 1879 earthquake, the image of the Virgin Mary remained unscathed, leading to the completion of a more robust church by 1886. The community’s faith was further tested during the Aglipayan Schism of 1902 when the chapel was seized; however, a landmark legal battle reaching the Supreme Court eventually restored the property to the Catholic Church in 1906. This victory culminated in a jubilant celebration on September 8, 1907—the Feast of the Nativity of Mary—when Archbishop Jeremias Harty officially elevated the chapel to a full parish, providing the community with its own dedicated pastor and a permanent spiritual home.

* **About:** Born from the generosity of Doña Geronima Gabriel, who donated a portion of her estate in 1896, the San Antonio de Padua Parish in Malabon evolved from a long-standing chapel under San Bartolome into an independent parish. Its transformation was triggered by a 1986 visit from Cardinal Jaime Sin, who noted that the structure was "too big for a chapel," leading to formal consultations and its canonical establishment on July 1, 1989. Known colloquially as the "floating church" due to frequent flooding, the parish saw significant structural improvements under its first pastor, Rev. Fr. Enrique Santos, who elevated the building and established its boundaries. Over the years, the community has continued to grow spiritually through the leadership of various priests, including Fr. Joselino Tuazon, who established the Perpetual Adoration, ensuring that the legacy of "Impong Memang" lives on through a steadfast and active congregation.

* **About:** The Sta. Cruz Parish in Barangay Tanza, Navotas, trace its origins back to the Spanish era as a small chapel under the jurisdiction of San Jose de Navotas, founded on the community’s deep devotion to the "Mahal na Poong Sta. Cruz." After decades of shared resources and "bayanihan" efforts, the community established a formal chapel, which was later placed under the care of San Roque Parish in 1951. To address the spiritual needs of a growing population, Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin elevated the community to a Quasi-Parish in 1990 before officially establishing it as a full parish on April 28, 1993, under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Martin Guarin. Through the successive terms of priests like Fr. Elpidio Erlano Jr., who completed the church structure, and Fr. Ildefonso de Guzman Jr., who modernized the Parish Pastoral Council, the parish has flourished into a vibrant religious center. Today, Sta. Cruz Parish manages four local chapels and remains dedicated to the spiritual growth of the Tanza community through the sacraments, formation programs, and active lay participation.

* **Parish Priest:** Fr. Ronaldo C. Pedroso
* **Address:** Don Basilio Bautista Blvd., cor. M. Sioson St. Dampalit, Malabon City
* **Contact No.:** Tel. 8-282-1416
* **Email:** storosario@dioceseofkalookan.ph or srpdampalit@gmail.com
* **About:** Built in the ornate Baroque style on land donated by Kapitana Elena Naval Paez, the Santo Rosario Parish in Dampalit, Malabon, began as a chapel under the Immaculate Conception Parish. The community, named either after the local "Dampalit" plant or the narrow "daang-paliit" roads, has a history rooted in deep Marian devotion that remained unshaken even as liturgical traditions evolved. A significant shift occurred in 1985 when an Archdiocesan Decree moved their primary feast day from New Year’s Day to the second Sunday of October to align more accurately with their patronage of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. Today, the parish serves as a center for both spiritual and socio-economic growth, with parishioners remaining steadfast in their faith and dedicated to the holistic improvement of their rising community.
