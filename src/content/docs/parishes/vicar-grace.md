* **About:** Established on May 5, 1946, as the first mission of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) in Kalookan City, Our Lady of Grace Parish evolved from a humble temporary hut into the oldest parish within its vicariate. Founded on land donated by the Philippine Realty Corporation and bolstered by the "Black Belters of Christ," the parish underwent rapid growth, necessitating the construction of a larger church by 1951 to accommodate its expanding congregation. In the spirit of the Second Vatican Council, the parish—alongside the OMI Fathers and OND Sisters—pioneered social and educational development through the formation of Basic Ecclesial Communities and the establishment of Notre Dame of Greater Manila. Today, the parish stands as a vital center of evangelization and community service, embodying the industrious and faithful spirit of St. Eugene de Mazenod while continuing its mission to serve the poor.

* **About:** Born from the gratitude of the Mandapat family for a relative’s safe return from World War II, Sagrada Familia Parish began as a modest wooden chapel that was officially initiated as a sub-parish in 1972. It was canonically erected as a parish in 1983 under its first priest, Rev. Fr. Honorato Nadua Jr., and has since flourished through a succession of leaders who prioritized grassroots spiritual growth. Notable developments include the strengthening of the Children’s Ministry and the rejuvenation of Basic Ecclesial Communities, which led to the creation of seventeen small communities known as Kawan and the Munting Kapitbahayang Kristiyano (MKK). Today, the parish is a highly active participant in vicarial and diocesan affairs, remaining dedicated to pastoral excellence and the formation of a unified brotherhood in Christ.

* **About:** Established in 1989 as the youngest member of the Our Lady of Grace Vicariate, San Jose Parish grew from a humble community chapel in Barrio San Jose built through the initiative of dedicated local residents. Originally under the guidance of neighboring parishes like Saint Pancratius and the leadership of Msgr. Melencio de Vera, the chapel was eventually canonically instituted as a parish under its first pastor, Rev. Fr. Arsenio Nalunat. Throughout its history, the parish has focused on strengthening communal ties through movements like the Neo Catecumenado and has maintained its spiritual resilience under the leadership of successive priests, including Rev. Fr. Jesus Jose C. Bustillo and the current parish priest, Rev. Fr. Ruben Maybuena. Today, San Jose Agudo Parish remains a testament to the community's enduring will to overcome challenges and grow in faith together.

* **About:** Established on October 11, 1962, by Cardinal Rufino Santos, this parish transitioned from being part of Binondo to a distinct community within the La Loma Cemetery area under the pioneering leadership of Msgr. Melencio de Vera. Serving a predominantly Catholic population of over 57,000, the parish has flourished through the support of 14 traditional lay associations and a series of dedicated pastors, including its current priest, Fr. Ardie Ong. Guided by a mission to bring the Church closer to the people, the community actively engages in street masses and charismatic movements while pursuing ambitious goals for a new formation center, a mortuary, and a school for the marginalized. As an active member of the Vicariate of Our Lady of Grace, the parish continues to foster a "big family" atmosphere that encourages spiritual growth and collective apostolic work.
