### Message to the Faithful

> Let us continue praying for our diocese and clergy as we move forward. Guided by the Holy Spirit, may we unite in service and spread God’s love, following the example of Christ the King, who calls us to live in unity and peace (Ephesians 4:3–6). May we walk together in faith, reflecting His reign of justice and compassion.
